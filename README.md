## 📊 Rapido Driver Onboarding and Earning Dashboard – Excel Project

This Excel dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of referral-based driver data for **Rapido**. It was developed entirely using **Microsoft Excel**, leveraging formulas, pivot tables, slicers, charts, and VBA macros for interactivity and automation.

### ✨ Features

- Used **Pivot Charts** to visualize Driver Status Distribution, Activation Rates, Earnings Summary, and more.

- **Clickable Rapido logo** redirects to the official Rapido homepage.
- Clean, minimal layout designed for easy navigation and presentation.

### 📈 Key Inferences from the Dashboard

#### 1. **Driver Status Distribution (Pie Chart)**
- Majority of drivers are categorized as **Old**, indicating good driver retention or reactivation.
- **New drivers** form a smaller slice, suggesting lower referral success or recent activity.
- Opportunity: Campaigns may need to focus on onboarding and activating new drivers.

#### 2. **City-wise Activation Trends**
- Some cities show significantly higher activation percentages.
- Suggests stronger ground teams or better regional engagement in those cities.
- Underperforming cities can be targeted for focused support.

#### 3. **Activation Status Analysis**
- A considerable portion of referrals are stuck in **'LTR'** or **'Pending'** statuses.
- Indicates possible bottlenecks in the activation pipeline.
- Quick action on these can convert more leads into active riders.

#### 4. **Earning vs. Payout Summary**
- A few entries show earning recorded but payout not marked as **'P-Credited'**.
- Important to flag for manual review — could lead to payout discrepancies or pending payments.
